## Adding New Datasets

To add a new economic indicator:

1. **Add a new chart section** in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <div class="chart-card">
       <div class="chart-header">
           <h3>Your New Dataset</h3>
           <span class="chart-subtitle">Description</span>
       </div>
       <div class="chart-container">
           <div class="skeleton-chart" id="new-chart-skeleton"></div>
           <canvas id="new-chart"></canvas>
           <a href="https://data.ssb.no/api/v0/dataset/XXXX.json?lang=en" target="_blank" class="source-link">SSB XXXX</a>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Add the chart initialization** in `scripts.js`:
   ```javascript
   // In the initializeCharts() function:
   loadChartData('new-chart', 'https://data.ssb.no/api/v0/dataset/XXXX.json?lang=en', 'Your Dataset Name', 'line');
   ```

3. **Find the correct SSB dataset ID**:
   - Visit [SSB PXWeb](https://www.ssb.no/en/statbank)
