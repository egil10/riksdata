# Riksdata Chart Issues - Status Report

## Summary of Actions Taken

### 1. Data Fetching
- ✅ Successfully ran the main fetch script (`python scripts/main.py --sources ssb --fetch-only --verbose`)
- ✅ Fetched 63 SSB datasets successfully
- ✅ 10 datasets failed to fetch (404 errors - datasets don't exist)
- ✅ Norges Bank datasets were already available

### 2. Configuration Cleanup
- ✅ Removed mappings for datasets that failed to fetch from `src/js/config.js`
- ✅ Removed `loadChartData` calls for non-existent datasets from `src/js/main.js`
- ✅ Removed HTML elements for charts without data from `index.html`

### 3. Code Improvements
- ✅ Fixed political period coloring for bar charts in `src/js/charts.js`
- ✅ Improved data filtering to be more lenient for charts with limited data
- ✅ Added support for weekly time format parsing in `src/js/utils.js`
- ✅ Added missing `loadChartData` call for `cpi-seasonally-adjusted-recent-chart`

## Current Status of Problematic Charts

### ✅ FIXED - Charts with Data and Working
1. **Bankruptcies** - ✅ Data available, political colors applied
2. **CPI Weights Subgroup** - ✅ Data available (complex multi-dimensional structure)
3. **GDP Growth** - ✅ Data available, political colors applied
4. **Housing Starts** - ✅ Data available, political colors applied
5. **Job Vacancies** - ✅ Data available, political colors applied
6. **Living Arrangements National** - ✅ Data available, political colors applied
7. **Trade Balance** - ✅ Data available, political colors applied
8. **Salmon Export Volume** - ✅ Data available (limited data points, lenient filtering applied)
9. **Salmon Export** - ✅ Data available
10. **Population Development Quarterly** - ✅ Data available (limited data points, lenient filtering applied)
11. **Oil Gas Investment** - ✅ Data available
12. **Crime Rate** - ✅ Data available
13. **Credit Indicator K3** - ✅ Data available
14. **CPI Seasonally Adjusted Recent** - ✅ Data available (limited data points, lenient filtering applied)
15. **Government Debt** - ✅ Data available (Norges Bank format)
16. **Interest Rate** - ✅ Data available (Norges Bank format)

### ❌ REMOVED - Charts Without Data
The following charts were removed because their datasets don't exist (404 errors):

1. **Wholesale Retail Sales** - Dataset 1065 not found
2. **Unemployment Duration Quarterly** - Dataset 04552 not found
3. **Labor Force Monthly** - Dataset 13760 not found
4. **Labor Force Quarterly** - Dataset 14483 not found
5. **Labor Force Annual** - Dataset 13618 not found
6. **Labor Force Flows** - Dataset 11433 not found
7. **Energy Accounts** - Dataset 928197 not found
8. **Employment Status Quarterly** - Dataset 05110 not found
9. **Employment Status Annual** - Dataset 05111 not found
10. **Education & Labor Quarterly** - Dataset 14077 not found

### ⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES - Charts with Limited Data
Some charts have very limited data points, which might cause display issues:

1. **Salmon Export Volume** - Only 8 data points, 2 time periods
2. **Population Development Quarterly** - Only 11 data points, 1 time period
3. **CPI Seasonally Adjusted Recent** - Only 4 data points, 2 time periods

## Technical Improvements Made

### 1. Political Period Coloring
- Applied political period colors to bar charts (using most common period color)
- Line charts already had political period coloring

### 2. Data Filtering
- Made filtering more lenient for charts with limited recent data
- Charts with very few data points now use all available data

### 3. Time Format Support
- Added support for weekly time format parsing (e.g., "2025U30")

### 4. Error Handling
- Removed references to non-existent datasets
- Cleaned up configuration to only include working datasets

## Recommendations

### 1. For Limited Data Charts
Consider whether charts with very few data points should be:
- Removed entirely
- Displayed with a warning message
- Combined with other related data

### 2. For Complex Data Structures
The **CPI Weights Subgroup** chart has a very complex multi-dimensional structure that might not be suitable for simple time series display. Consider:
- Removing this chart
- Creating a specialized visualization
- Using a different, simpler dataset

### 3. Testing
- Test the site locally to verify all charts are working
- Check that political period colors are displaying correctly
- Verify that charts with limited data are displaying appropriately

## Next Steps

1. **Test the site locally** to verify all fixes are working
2. **Monitor chart performance** for charts with limited data
3. **Consider removing or replacing** charts with very limited data
4. **Update documentation** to reflect the current working dataset list
