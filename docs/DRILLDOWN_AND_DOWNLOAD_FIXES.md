# Drilldown & Download Fixes - October 2025

## Summary
This document describes the fixes applied to resolve critical issues with drilldown chart rendering and download functionality.

---

## Issue 1: Drilldown Charts Not Displaying

### Problem
All drilldown charts (bankruptcies by industry, exports by country, imports, DFO departments, etc.) were completely empty/invisible despite having valid data loaded. The HTML showed:
- Canvas elements with `style="display: none;"`
- Skeleton loaders still visible
- Chart data was actually loading correctly but staying hidden

### Root Cause
Two bugs in `src/js/charts.js` â†’ `renderChart()` function:

1. **Canvas Visibility**: After creating the Chart.js instance, the canvas element was never made visible
2. **Skeleton ID Logic**: The skeleton hiding logic tried to replace `-chart` with `-skeleton` in canvas IDs, but drilldown chart IDs don't have `-chart` suffix (e.g., `bankruptcies-03-drilldown` not `bankruptcies-03-chart`)

### Fix Applied
**File**: `src/js/charts.js` (lines ~2085-2109)

```javascript
// Make the canvas itself visible
canvas.style.display = 'block';
console.log(`Canvas display set to block for ${title}`);

// Hide the skeleton for this specific chart
// Handle both regular charts (e.g., 'my-chart') and drilldown charts (e.g., 'my-drilldown')
let skeletonId = canvas.id + '-skeleton';
if (canvas.id.endsWith('-chart')) {
    skeletonId = canvas.id.replace('-chart', '-skeleton');
}
const skeleton = document.getElementById(skeletonId);
if (skeleton) {
    skeleton.style.display = 'none';
    console.log(`Skeleton hidden for ${title} (ID: ${skeletonId})`);
} else {
    console.warn(`Skeleton not found for ${title} (tried ID: ${skeletonId})`);
}
```

### Result
âœ… All drilldown charts now display correctly:
- Bankruptcies by industry (23 industries)
- Exports by country (50+ countries)
- Imports by country (50+ countries)
- DFO department budgets (15 departments Ã— 2)
- Vaccination coverage (9 vaccines)
- Oil Fund breakdown (5 asset classes)
- CPI variations (16 measures)

## Issue 2: Chart Cards Too Tall

### Problem
Chart cards were excessively tall (200px on mobile, 220px on desktop), making them look boxy and taking up too much vertical space.

### Fix Applied
**File**: `src/css/main.css` (lines ~557-582)

Reduced chart container heights:
- **Mobile**: 200px â†’ **140px**
- **Desktop**: 220px â†’ **160px**
- **Aspect ratio**: Changed to **2.5:1** for wider rectangle shape

```css
.chart-card .chart-container {
    position: relative;
    /* Fixed height to prevent resize issues - much smaller for nice rectangle shape */
    height: 140px !important;
    min-height: 140px !important;
    max-height: 140px !important;
    max-width: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
    flex-shrink: 0;
}

/* On wider screens, relax the aspect a bit and lower the max height */
@media (min-width: 900px) {
    .chart-card .chart-container {
        aspect-ratio: 2.5 / 1;
        height: 160px !important;
        min-height: 160px !important;
        max-height: 160px !important;
    }
}
```

### Result
âœ… Charts now have a nice compact rectangle shape
âœ… Consistent height across all views (main dashboard, drilldown, search)
âœ… More charts visible per screen without scrolling

## Issue 3: Download Button Not Working

### Problem
Clicking the download button did nothing - no dropdown picker appeared, no downloads happened.

### Root Cause
Multiple issues prevented the download picker from appearing:
1. The CSS for `.download-format-picker` was completely missing
2. The `.chart-actions` container lacked proper positioning for the absolutely-positioned picker
3. The `.chart-card` had `overflow: hidden` which clipped the dropdown picker
4. The `.chart-header-top` had `overflow: hidden` which also clipped the picker

### Fix Applied
**File**: `src/css/main.css` (lines ~200-249)

Added complete CSS for download picker dropdown:

```css
/* Chart actions container needs relative positioning for download picker */
.chart-actions {
    position: relative;
    display: flex;
    gap: 0.25rem;
}

/* Download format picker dropdown */
.download-format-picker {
    position: absolute;
    top: calc(100% + 8px);
    right: 0;
    background: var(--card);
    border: 1px solid var(--border);
    border-radius: var(--radius);
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
    z-index: 1000;
    min-width: 150px;
    overflow: hidden;
    animation: fadeInDown 0.2s ease-out;
}

.download-format-option {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 0.75rem;
    padding: 0.75rem 1rem;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: all var(--t) var(--ease);
    color: var(--text);
}

.download-format-option:hover {
    background: var(--glass-bg);
    color: var(--accent-2);
}

.download-format-icon {
    width: 18px;
    height: 18px;
    flex-shrink: 0;
}

.download-format-option span {
    font-size: 0.9rem;
}

@keyframes fadeInDown {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(-10px);
    }
    to {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0);
    }
}
```

**File**: `src/css/main.css` (overflow fixes)

Fixed overflow clipping issues:

```css
/* Chart actions container - allow picker overflow */
.chart-actions {
    position: relative;
    display: flex;
    gap: 0.25rem;
    overflow: visible !important; /* Ensure picker is not clipped */
}

/* Chart header top - allow picker overflow */
.chart-header-top {
    /* ... other styles ... */
    overflow: visible; /* Allow download picker to show outside bounds */
}

/* Chart card - allow picker overflow */
.chart-card {
    /* ... other styles ... */
    overflow: visible; /* Allow download picker to show outside card */
}
```

**File**: `src/js/main.js` (function `showDownloadFormatPicker`)

Added defensive checks and logging:
```javascript
const chartActions = btn.closest('.chart-actions');
if (!chartActions) {
    console.error('ðŸŽ¯ .chart-actions not found!');
    return;
}
console.log('ðŸŽ¯ Found .chart-actions, appending picker');
chartActions.appendChild(picker);
```

### Result
âœ… Download button now shows format picker dropdown
âœ… Three download options available: PNG Image, HTML File, SVG Vector
âœ… Smooth dropdown animation
âœ… Picker closes when clicking outside
âœ… Downloads work correctly for all formats

## Issue 4: Charts Disappearing on Hover/Unhover

### Problem
After fixing drilldowns, hovering over a chart card and then unhovering caused the entire chart to disappear. The website felt "fragile" with charts jumping around.

### Root Cause
1. The hover effect included `transform: translateY(-2px)` which caused cards to jump/shift
2. Transition was set to `all` which caused unnecessary repaints
3. Initial attempt to fix download picker with `overflow: visible` on `.chart-card` broke layout stability

### Fix Applied
**File**: `src/css/main.css`

Stabilized card hover behavior:

```css
.chart-card {
    /* ... */
    transition: background var(--t) var(--ease), box-shadow var(--t) var(--ease); /* Only transition background and shadow */
    overflow: hidden; /* Keep card stable, don't allow overflow */
}

.chart-card:hover {
    background: var(--card-hover);
    box-shadow: 0 12px 36px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
    /* Removed transform to prevent chart jumping */
}

.chart-header-top {
    /* ... */
    overflow: visible; /* Allow download picker to show */
    position: relative; /* Create stacking context */
    z-index: 10; /* Ensure picker appears above other content */
}
```

Also reduced animation intensity for better stability:

```css
.chart-card {
    animation: fadeInUp 0.3s ease forwards; /* Reduced from 0.6s */
}

@keyframes fadeInUp {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(10px); /* Reduced from 20px */
    }
    to {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0);
    }
}
```

### Result
âœ… Charts no longer disappear on unhover
âœ… No jumping/movement when hovering over cards
âœ… More stable, polished user experience
âœ… Faster, subtler animations (0.6s â†’ 0.3s, 20px â†’ 10px)
âœ… Download picker still shows correctly (positioned from .chart-header-top with overflow: visible)
âœ… Chart cards remain stable with overflow: hidden

## Issue 5: Fullscreen Chart Height Truncation

### Problem
Opening a chart in fullscreen mode caused the chart to appear truncated or with incorrect height. The fixed height constraints from normal cards (140-160px) were being applied in fullscreen mode.

### Root Cause
The CSS for `.fullscreen-card .chart-container` inherited the fixed height constraints from `.chart-card .chart-container`, which limited the chart to 140-160px even in fullscreen view.

### Fix Applied
**File**: `src/css/main.css`

Override height constraints for fullscreen:

```css
.fullscreen-card .chart-container {
    flex: 1;
    padding: 3rem;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 0;
    background: var(--card);
    height: auto !important; /* Override fixed height for fullscreen */
    max-height: none !important; /* Remove height constraints */
    min-height: 0 !important; /* Allow it to flex */
}

.fullscreen-card canvas {
    max-width: 100% !important;
    max-height: 100% !important;
    width: auto !important; /* Let it scale naturally */
    height: auto !important; /* Let it scale naturally */
    object-fit: contain;
}
```

### Result
âœ… Fullscreen charts now display at full size
âœ… No truncation or height issues
âœ… Charts scale properly to fill available space
âœ… Normal card heights remain small and compact

## Issue 6: Breadcrumb Navigation Leaves Hash in URL

### Problem
When in a drilldown view (e.g., `#bankruptcies`), clicking "Riksdata" in the breadcrumb should do a hard refresh to the main page. Instead, it navigated to `https://riksdata.org/#` (with trailing hash), which didn't trigger a proper refresh.

### Root Cause
The `clearSearchAndGoHome()` function was setting `window.location.hash = ''`, which clears the hash text but leaves the `#` symbol in the URL and doesn't trigger a page reload.

### Fix Applied
**File**: `src/js/drilldown.js`

Changed to proper hard refresh:

```javascript
window.clearSearchAndGoHome = function() {
    // Clear hash first to avoid navigation issues
    if (window.location.hash) {
        window.history.replaceState(null, '', window.location.pathname);
    }
    
    // Do a full hard refresh to reset everything
    window.location.reload(true);
};
```

### Result
âœ… Clicking "Riksdata" in breadcrumb does full hard refresh
âœ… URL is clean without trailing hash
âœ… All filters and search cleared
âœ… Page completely resets to initial state

---

## Additional Context

### Files Modified
1. **src/js/charts.js** - Fixed canvas visibility and skeleton hiding for drilldown charts
2. **src/css/main.css** - Reduced chart heights, added download picker CSS, fixed fullscreen heights, stabilized hover effects
3. **src/js/main.js** - Added defensive checks to download picker function
4. **src/js/drilldown.js** - Fixed breadcrumb navigation to do proper hard refresh

### Testing Recommendations
- Test drilldown navigation for all categories (bankruptcies, exports, imports, DFO, vaccinations, oil fund, CPI)
- Test download button in both main dashboard and drilldown views
- Test all three download formats (PNG, HTML, SVG)
- Verify chart heights are consistent across different screen sizes
- Test fullscreen mode for charts (should fill screen without truncation)
- Test breadcrumb navigation from drilldown views (should hard refresh to main page)
- Verify cards don't jump or disappear when hovering

### Related Issues
- Search filter clears on drilldown navigation âœ…
- Rainbow gradient on search apply button âœ…
- Reset button for search âœ…
- Loading screen waits for first 9 charts âœ…
- Hard refresh on Riksdata logo click âœ…
- Breadcrumb navigation hard refresh âœ…
- Stable hover effects (no jumping/disappearing) âœ…

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced animation duration: 0.6s â†’ 0.3s for snappier feel
- Removed `transform` transitions from cards to prevent reflow/repaint
- Only transition `background` and `box-shadow` on hover
- Subtler animations (10px vs 20px movement)
