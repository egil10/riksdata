## File Changes

### 1. `src/js/chart-configs.js`
- âœ… Added 176 SSB chart configurations
- âœ… Organized by logical categories
- âœ… Updated total chart count comment

### 2. `src/js/config.js`
- âœ… Added comprehensive dataset mappings for all 125 SSB files
- âœ… Organized mappings by category
- âœ… Matches file names in `data/cached/ssb/`

## How It Works

1. **Chart Configuration** (`chart-configs.js`)
   - Each chart has an `id`, `url`, `title`, and optional `subtitle`
   - URL points to SSB API (e.g., `https://data.ssb.no/api/v0/dataset/1086.json`)
   - The system extracts the dataset ID (e.g., `1086`) from the URL

2. **Cache Mapping** (`config.js`)
   - Maps dataset ID â†’ cache filename (e.g., `'1086': 'cpi'`)
   - System loads from `data/cached/ssb/cpi.json` instead of hitting SSB API

3. **Data Loading** (`charts.js`)
   - Detects SSB URLs
   - Looks up cache filename from mapping
   - Loads cached JSON file
   - Parses SSB PXWeb format
   - Renders chart with political period coloring

## Next Steps

### Already Done âœ…
- All 125 SSB files have chart configurations
- All dataset mappings are in place
- No linting errors

### What You Can Do Now
1. **Test the charts** - Open your website and scroll through to see all the SSB charts
2. **Check for any missing data** - Some charts might share the same cached file (intentional)
3. **Customize titles** - Adjust any chart titles to make them more descriptive
4. **Add more subtitles** - Some charts could benefit from more descriptive subtitles

## Notes

- Some charts use the same cached file with different IDs (this is intentional for different views of the same data)
- All charts are set to filter data from 1945 onwards (Norwegian political period start)
- Charts use political period coloring automatically
- Data is cached locally to reduce API calls and improve performance
- The SSB data format (PXWeb JSON) is automatically parsed by the system
